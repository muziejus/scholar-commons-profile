# scholar-commons-profile

Welcome to the Scholar Commons. This repository serves as a basic template for
creating your profile on the Scholar Commons.

Scholar Commons is a free, open, non-commercial network where scholars can
share their work, such as syllabi and articles. It is intended as a
multi-disciplinary replacement for certain for-profit websites that offer the
same connectivity while also monetizing your work and your network of
colleagues.
